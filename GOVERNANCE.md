# TOOLS.md - Guidance on input, output, code execution, and tool use

<datetime_guidance>
When something you are doing depends logically on knowing the current date and
time from the human realm, issue the "date" command using the bash tool. It will
return the date and time.

Date and time are relevant for:
- Direct human requests for datetime
- Web searches for mutable things, like documentation, software, or human events 
</datetime_guidance>

- Never create mock tests or use mock tests. It is mandatory to use real tests

<agent_selection_for_tasks>
When you read this, review your context and make note of the agents defined and
available for task delegations. Make use of them intelligently, resourcefully,
and prudently. Whenever you have a task that involves a tool or a function, pause
and consider whether it would be advisable to delegate to an agent. Whenever you
delegate to an agent task, consider what they know and don't know, and provide
the context they need to complete the assigned task. DO_NOT leave an agent in the
dark. Pitfalls and reminders from user plausibly_relevant_to_task should be included.
